# Merlynn-ai-graduate-position-assignment

Project Setup:

  - Create a new react app using command line: npx create-react-app my-app
  - Once the files are created replace the files of the newly created app with the ones on the git repository (all files should have been replaced except the node_modules folder).
  - Next open the terminal in the same directory as where the files have been replaced and install the following: npm install axios 
  - After it has finished run the following command to start the project: npm start

Additions:
  - Used TailwindCSS to style the page.
  - Added some basic validation to make sure all the input fields are filled in before the form is submitted.
